# facebook-export-tools
Tools for working with facebook export data

## Requirements
This has only been tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.10.11, but feel free to try it on other platforms.  
I have not done the work to make this compatible with non-Windows systems, so you may need to make some changes to the code.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Setup a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements
4. Run the script

```bash
git clone [repository]
cd facebook-export-tools
python3 -m venv venv
./venv/Scrips/activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
